## Interesting Papers:


### Brain Oscillations
* Traveling waves in the brain and understanding their propagation. Seems to focus on alpha (10 Hz). [The Hidden Spatial Dimension of Alpha: 10-Hz Perceptual Echoes Propagate as Periodic Traveling Waves in the Human Brain](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)32003-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124718320035%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

### Noise
* [Noise in the nervous system by A. Aldo Faisal et al](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/Public/Wolpert/Publications/FaiSelWol08.pdf). Looks like a really interesting and has good explainations on understanding what noise actually is.

### Entropy
* [Entropy explained](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-intuition-behind-shannons-entropy-e74820fe9800) with some python implimentation.

### Dimensionality
* [Towards the neural population doctrine](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/pdf/SaxenaCONB2019.pdf)
>> We detail four areas of the field where the joint analysis of neural populations has significantly furthered our understanding of computation in the brain: correlated variability, decoding, neural dynamics, and artificial neural networks.

* [Perform non-linear dimensionality reduction with Isomap and LLE in Python from scratch](https://towardsdatascience.com/step-by-step-signal-processing-with-machine-learning-manifold-learning-8e1bb192461c)

* [Isomap tutorial](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.02-introducing-scikit-learn.html)

* [A Global Geometric Framework for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/290/5500/2319)
>> Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.

### Modeling

* A guide for applying [Machine learning for neural decoding](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1708/1708.00909.pdf). 
>> Description: This	 tutorial	 describes	 how	 to effectively	 apply	 these	 algorithms	 for	 typical	 decoding	 problems.	 We	 provide	 descriptions,	 best practices,	and	code	for	applying	common	machine	learning	methods,	including	neural	networks	and	gradient	boosting.	We	also	provide	detailed	comparisons	of	the	performance	of	various	methods	at the	 task	 of	 decoding	 spiking	 activity	 in	 motor	 cortex,	 somatosensory	 cortex,	 and	 hippocampus.

## Videos

* [Gradients of Brain Organization Workshop](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/channels/event/virtual-gradients-brain-organization-workshop-zoom-302746). 
>> Description: Recent years have seen a rise of new methods and applications to study smooth spatial transitions — or gradients — of brain organization. Identification and analysis of cortical gradients provides a framework to study brain organization across species, to examine changes in brain development and aging, and to more generally study the interrelation between brain structure, function and cognition. We will bring together outstanding junior and senior scientists to discuss the challenges and opportunities afforded by this emerging perspective.
