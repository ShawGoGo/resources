# List of Resources
A collaborative list of resources for Computational Neuroscience


## Interesting Papers:

### Brain Oscillations
* Traveling waves in the brain and understanding their propagation. Seems to focus on alpha (10 Hz). [The Hidden Spatial Dimension of Alpha: 10-Hz Perceptual Echoes Propagate as Periodic Traveling Waves in the Human Brain](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)32003-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124718320035%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

### Noise
* [Noise in the nervous system by A. Aldo Faisal et al](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/Public/Wolpert/Publications/FaiSelWol08.pdf). Looks like a really interesting and has good explainations on understanding what noise actually is.


### Modeling
* [A How-to-Model Guide for Neuroscience](https://www.eneuro.org/content/7/1/ENEURO.0352-19.2019). Steps on how to go about posing questions that models can answer. 

* [Direct Fit to Nature: An Evolutionary Perspective on Biological and Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S089662731931044X)

* [Slide deck](http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/teaching/statneuro2018/slides/slides07_encodingmodels.pdf) on maximum likelihood estimation for neural data by Jonathan Pillow


#### Optimization
* BOOK:[Resources by Boyd and Vandenberghe](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) covering convex optimization and appproaches.

### Machine Learning 

* [Reconciling modern machine-learning practice and the classical bias–variance trade-off](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15849)




## Books 

* [Mathematics for Machine Learning by A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong, and Marc Peter Deisenroth](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)

* [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf). See chapter 28 for Model Comparison and Occam’s Razor for model simplicity.

## Datasets

* A list of open [datasets](https://github.com/openlists/ElectrophysiologyData) that span EEG, MEG, ECoG, and LFP. 

* A large list of [BCI resources](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/awesome-bci#brain-databases) including datasets, tutorials, papers, books etc. 

* The [TUH EEG Corpus](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml), a list of several EEG dataset with several resources. Requies filling out form to download the data.
