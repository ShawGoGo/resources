## Interesting Papers:

### Brain Oscillations
* Traveling waves in the brain and understanding their propagation. Seems to focus on alpha (10 Hz). [The Hidden Spatial Dimension of Alpha: 10-Hz Perceptual Echoes Propagate as Periodic Traveling Waves in the Human Brain](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)32003-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124718320035%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

### Noise
* [Noise in the nervous system by A. Aldo Faisal et al](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/Public/Wolpert/Publications/FaiSelWol08.pdf). Looks like a really interesting and has good explainations on understanding what noise actually is.


### Modeling
* [A How-to-Model Guide for Neuroscience](https://www.eneuro.org/content/7/1/ENEURO.0352-19.2019). Steps on how to go about posing questions that models can answer. 

* [Direct Fit to Nature: An Evolutionary Perspective on Biological and Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S089662731931044X)

* Preprint on [Neural Network Poisson Models for Behavioural and Neural Spike Train Data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.201673v1.abstract) by Dayan's group. 

* Maximum likelihood estimation for neural data [slide deck](http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/teaching/statneuro2018/slides/slides07_encodingmodels.pdf) by Jonathan Pillow. A walk through of the concept and derivation.


#### Optimization
* **BOOK**: [Resources by Boyd and Vandenberghe](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) covering convex optimization and appproaches.

### Machine Learning 

* [Reconciling modern machine-learning practice and the classical bias–variance trade-off](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15849)




## Books

## Datasets

* A list of open [datasets](https://github.com/openlists/ElectrophysiologyData) that span EEG, MEG, ECoG, and LFP. 

* A large list of [BCI resources](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/awesome-bci#brain-databases) including datasets, tutorials, papers, books etc. 

* The [TUH EEG Corpus](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml), a list of several EEG dataset with several resources. Requies filling out form to download the data.  

* [Project Tycho named after Tycho Brache](). The project aims to share reliable massive neural and behavioral data for understanding brain mechanism.
>>**[Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe)** was a Danish nobleman, astronomer, and writer known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical observations. He was born in the then Danish peninsula of Scania. Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist.

## Videos

* [Gradients of Brain Organization Workshop](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/channels/event/virtual-gradients-brain-organization-workshop-zoom-302746). 
>> Description: Recent years have seen a rise of new methods and applications to study smooth spatial transitions — or gradients — of brain organization. Identification and analysis of cortical gradients provides a framework to study brain organization across species, to examine changes in brain development and aging, and to more generally study the interrelation between brain structure, function and cognition. We will bring together outstanding junior and senior scientists to discuss the challenges and opportunities afforded by this emerging perspective.
