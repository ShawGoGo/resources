## Interesting Papers:

* Traveling waves in the brain and understanding their propagation. Seems to focus on alpha (10 Hz). [The Hidden Spatial Dimension of Alpha: 10-Hz Perceptual Echoes Propagate as Periodic Traveling Waves in the Human Brain](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)32003-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124718320035%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

### Noise
* [Noise in the nervous system by A. Aldo Faisal et al](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/Public/Wolpert/Publications/FaiSelWol08.pdf). Looks like a really interesting and has good explainations on understanding what noise actually is.

### Modeling
* [A How-to-Model Guide for Neuroscience](https://www.eneuro.org/content/7/1/ENEURO.0352-19.2019). Steps on how to go about posing questions that models can answer. 

## Books 

* [Mathematics for Machine Learning by A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong, and Marc Peter Deisenroth](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)

* [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf). See chapter 28 for Model Comparison and Occamâ€™s Razor for model simplicity.
